A tiny C++ (mostly C) web-server that calls function pointers for requests and 
logging. Based on IBM's open-source small "nweb" web server 
(http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/systems/library/es-nweb/).

This is a rough port using statically-sized strings, with some unfortunate 
remnants of the original example still needing to be removed.

Updates will be uploaded, imminently.
